Prior to averaging, the DNB data is filtered to exclude data impacted by stray light, lightning, lunar illumination, and cloud-cover. Cloud-cover is determined using the VIIRS Cloud Mask product (VCM). In addition, data near the edges of the swath are not included in the composites (aggregation zones 29-32). Temporal averaging is done on a monthly and annual basis. The version 1 series of monthly composites has not been filtered to screen out lights from aurora, fires, boats, and other temporal lights. However, the annual composites have layers with additional separation, removing temporal lights and background (non-light) values. The version 1 products span the globe from 75N latitude to 65S. The products are produced in 15 arc-second geographic grids and are made available in geotiff format as a set of 6 tiles. The tiles are cut at the equator and each span 120 degrees of latitude. Each tile is actually a set of images containing average radiance values and numbers of available observations. Monthly Cloud-free DNB Composite In the monthly cloud-free DNB composites, there are many areas of the globe where it is impossible to get good quality data coverage for that month. This can be due to cloud-cover, especially in the tropical regions, or due to solar illumination, as happens toward the poles in their respective summer months. Therefore, it is imperative that users of these data utilize the cloud-free observations file and not assume a value of zero in the average radiance image means that no lights were observed. The version 1 monthly series is run globally using two different configurations. The first excludes any data impacted by stray light. The second includes these data if the radiance values have undergone the stray-light correction procedure (Reference). These two configurations are denoted in the filenames as \"vcm\" and \"vcmsl\" respectively. The \"vcmsl\" version, that includes the stray-light corrected data, will have more data coverage toward the poles, but will be of reduced quality. It is up to the users to determine which set is best for their applications.

Note: The global coverage of monthly VNL is greatly affected by the length of day in different time of year. In summer time northern hemisphere will have less nighttime coverage due to longer day. Annual VNL V2 A new consistently processed time series of annual global VIIRS nighttime lights has been produced from monthly cloud-free average radiance grids spanning 2012* to 2020. The new methodology is a modification of the original method based on nightly data (Annual VNL V1). For 2012 annual VNL V2, there are two sets. (A) 201204-201212, and (B) 201204-201303. Only set (B) has masked median and average, as well as lit area mask. In both methods there is an initial filtering to remove sunlit, moonlit and cloudy pixels, leading to rough composites that contains lights, fires, aurora and background. In the original method, the rough annual composites are made from a full year of nightly DNB data. In the new method, the rough composites are made on monthly increments and then combined to form rough annual composites. Both methods employ outlier removal to discard biomass burning pixels and isolate the background. In the original method the outlier removal is performed on scattergrams generated for each 15 arc second grid cell, with outliers clipped off from both the high and low radiance sides of the scattergram. The discard of outlier pixels proceeds until the scattergram\u2019s standard deviation stabilizes. The new method uses the twelve-month median radiance to discard high and low radiance outliers, filtering out most fires and isolating the background. Background areas are zeroed out in both methods using the data range (DR) calculated from 3x3 grid cells. In both methods, the DR threshold for background is indexed to cloud-cover levels, with higher DR thresholds in areas having low numbers of cloud-free coverages. In the new method, particular attention is given to setting a single DR threshold for distinguishing lit grid cells from background for each 15 arc second grid cell. This is achieved by setting the DR threshold from a multiyear maximum median and a corresponding multiyear percent cloud-cover grids. The multiyear approach makes it possible to detect lighting present in each 15 arc second grid cell with a single DR threshold across all the years in the series.

Global Human Settlement Layer - JRC The Global Human Settlement (GHS) - http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu - framework produces global spatial information about the human presence on the planet over time. This in the form of built up maps, population density maps and settlement maps. This information is generated with evidence-based analytics and knowledge using new spatial data mining technologies. The framework uses heterogeneous data including global archives of fine-scale satellite imagery, census data, and volunteered geographic information. The data is processed fully automatically and generates analytics and knowledge reporting objectively and systematically about the presence of population and built-up infrastructures. The main datasets are offered for download as open and free data. The GHS P2016 suite consists of multitemporal products, that offers an insight into the human presence in the past: 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2014. There are three main type of products: built-up ( GHS-BUILT ), population ( GHS-POP ), city model ( GHS-SMOD ). The grid data are distributed as raster files in TIF format. The ZIP files contain raster files together with pyramids (i.e., TIF and OVR files).

World Settlement Footprint Human settlements are the cause and consequence of most environmental and societal changes on Earth; however, their location and extent is still under debate. We provide here a new 10m resolution ( 0.32 arcsec ) global map of human settlements on Earth for the year 2015, namely the World Settlement Footprint 2015 (WSF2015). The raster dataset has been generated by means of an advanced classification system which, for the first time, jointly exploits open-and-free optical and radar satellite imagery. The WSF2015 has been validated against 900,000 samples labelled by crowdsourcing photointerpretation of very high resolution Google Earth imagery and outperforms all other similar existing layers; in particular, it considerably improves the detection of very small settlements in rural regions and better outlines scattered suburban areas. The dataset can be used at any scale of observation in support to all applications requiring detailed and accurate information on human presence (e.g., socioeconomic development, population distribution, risks assessment, etc.). The World Settlement Footprint (WSF) 2015 is a 10m ( 0.32 arcsec ) resolution binary mask outlining the 2015 global settlement extent derived by jointly exploiting multitemporal Sentinel-1 radar and Landsat-8 optical satellite imagery. The archive is organized for download in 306 GeoTIFF files ( EPSG:4326 projection, deflate compression) each one referring to a portion of 10x10 degree size ( 1110x1110km ) whose upper-left and lower-right corner coordinates are specified in the file name [e.g., the tile WSF2015_v1_EPSG4326_e010_n60_e020_n50.tif covers the area between ( 10E;60N ) and ( 20E;50N )]. A virtual mosaic file (i.e., WSF2015_v1_EPSG4326.vrt ) is also provided which allows visualizing the global product at once on most diffused GIS platforms (e.g., ArcGIS, QGIS, MapInfo).

Vegetation Indices Vegetation indices, usually produced on 8 or 16-day and monthly intervals and at multiple spatial resolutions, provide consistent spatial and temporal comparisons of vegetation canopy greenness, a composite property of leaf area, chlorophyll and canopy structure. Two vegetation indices are derived from atmospherically-corrected reflectance in the red, near-infrared, and blue wavebands; the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), which minimizes canopy-soil variations and improves sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The two products more effectively characterize the global range of vegetation states and processes. MODIS The MOD13A1 and MOD13Q1 Version 6 product provides Vegetation Index (VI) values at a per pixel basis at 1 kilometer (km) and 250 meter (m) spatial resolution. There are two primary vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over high biomass regions. The algorithm for this product chooses the best available pixel value from all the acquisitions from the 16 day period. The criteria used is low clouds, low view angle and the highest NDVI/EVI value.

Cropland includes areas used for the production of adapted crops for harvest. Two subcategories of cropland are recognized: cultivated and non-cultivated. Cultivated cropland comprises land in row crops or close-grown crops and also other cultivated cropland, for example, hay land or pasture land that is in a rotation with row or close-grown crops. Non-cultivated cropland includes permanent hay land and horticultural cropland. GFSAD30 The GFSAD30 is a NASA-funded project to provide high-resolution global cropland data and their water use that contributes towards global food security in the twenty-first century. The GFSAD30 products are derived through multi-sensor remote sensing data (e.g., Landsat, MODIS, AVHRR), secondary data, and field-plot data and aims at documenting cropland dynamics from 1990 to 2017.

A set of multi-year MODIS metrics incorporating four MODIS land bands, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and thermal data was employed to depict cropland phenology over the period 2000-2008. With a spatial resolution of 250m, the Global Cropland Extent product represents the finest-scale global cropland map derived using synoptic inputs, and due to the inclusion of 9 years of MODIS data it is designed to be relatively insensitive to inter-annual variability in depicting core cropland production areas.

Land cover data documents how much of a region is covered by forests, wetlands, impervious surfaces, agriculture, and other land and water types. Water types include wetlands or open water. Land use shows how people use the landscape \u2013 whether for development, conservation, or mixed uses. The different types of land cover can be managed or used quite differently. Land cover can be determined by analyzing satellite and aerial imagery. Land use cannot be determined from satellite imagery. Land cover maps provide information to help managers best understand the current landscape. To see change over time, land cover maps for several different years are needed. Copernicus Copernicus Global Landcover is a discrete map and 10 continuous cover fractions (9 base land cover classes and seasonal water) to provide spatial information about land for a diversity of applications ranging from global forest monitoring, global crop monitoring, biodiversity and nature conservation to climate modelling.

MODIS The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS/Terra Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity 8-Day L3 Global 1 km Grid SIN V006 (MOD11A2) dataset provides global land surface temperature data (LST). The MOD11A2 version 6 product provides an average, 8-day, per-pixel LST in a 1200 x 1200 kilometer grid. Each pixel value in the MOD11A2 is a simple average of all the corresponding MOD11A1 LST pixels collected within that 8 day period. The 8 day compositing period was chosen because twice that period is the exact ground track repeat period of the Terra and Aqua platforms. The MOD11C3 Version 6 product provides monthly Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&E) values in a 0.05 degree (5,600 meters at the equator) latitude/longitude Climate Modeling Grid (CMG). A CMG granule is a geographic grid with 7,200 columns and 3,600 rows representing the entire globe.

Evapotranspiration Evapotranspiration (ET), for the most part, is the combination of transpiration from vegetation and evaporation from soil surfaces. SSEBop Actual ET (ETa) is produced using the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model (Senay et al., 2013) for 2003 to present. The SSEBop setup is based on the Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEB) approach (Senay et al., 2007, 2011) with unique parameterization for operational applications. It combines ET fractions generated from remotely sensed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal imagery, acquired every 10 days, with reference ET using a thermal index approach. The unique feature of the SSEBop parameterization is that it uses a pre-defined, seasonally and spatially dynamic surface psychrometer parameter to calculate ET fraction as the difference between observed LST (dry-bulb) and a cold/wet boundary condition (wet-bulb) using the principle of satellite psychrometry (Senay, 2018). The original formulation of SSEB is an adaptation of the hot and cold pixel principle of SEBAL (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998) and METRIC (Allen et al., 2007) models. A recent evaluation of the global ETa product shows promising performance of ETa Anomaly for drought monitoring purposes while water budget studies, requiring absolute magnitudes, may need to apply a local/region-specific bias correction procedure (Senay et. al, 2020). ETa data and anomaly products (current vs. 2003 \u2013 2015) are available at: https://earlywarning.usgs.gov/fews .

The anomalies are the ratio of ETa and the corresponding median ETa, expressed as a percent value and have the color ramp below.

MODIS The MOD16A2 Version 6 Evapotranspiration/Latent Heat Flux product is an 8-day composite dataset produced at 500 meter (m) pixel resolution. The algorithm used for the MOD16 data product collection is based on the logic of the Penman-Monteith equation, which includes inputs of daily meteorological reanalysis data along with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remotely sensed data products such as vegetation property dynamics, albedo, and land cover. Provided in the MOD16A2 product are layers for composited Evapotranspiration (ET), Latent Heat Flux (LE), Potential ET (PET) and Potential LE (PLE) along with a quality control layer. Two low resolution browse images, ET and LE, are also available for each MOD16A2 granule. The pixel values for the two Evapotranspiration layers (ET and PET) are the sum of all eight days within the composite period and the pixel values for the two Latent Heat layers (LE and PLE) are the average of all eight days within the composite period. Note that the last acquisition period of each year is a 5 or 6-day composite period, depending on the year.

Snow Snow cover and extent data is very important for RBB to help monitor the situation in some countries: Mongolia, DPR Korea, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal and Bhutan. MODIS The data set provides the maximum snow cover extent observed over an eight-day period within 10\u00b0 x 10\u00b0 MODIS sinusoidal grid tiles. Tiles are generated by compositing 500 m observations from the 'MODIS/Terra Snow Cover Daily L3 Global 500m Grid' data set. Maximum snow cover extent is generated by reading 8 days of 500 m resolution MOD10A1 tiles. If snow is observed in a cell on any day in the period, the cell is mapped as snow. If no snow is found, the cell is filled with the clear-view observation that occurred most often (e.g. snow free land, ocean, etc.). Cloud cover is only reported if the cell was cloud-obscured for all eight days in the period. Snow cover is detected using the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI). Snow-covered land typically has a very high reflectance in visible bands and very low reflectance in the shortwave infrared; the NDSI reveals the magnitude of this difference.

Cloud Cover Cloud cover can influence numerous important ecological processes including reproduction, growth, survival, and behavior, yet our assessment of its importance at the appropriate spatial scales has remained remarkably limited. If captured over large extent yet at sufficiently fine spatial grain cloud cover dynamics may provide key information for delineating a variety of habitat types and predicting species distributions. Cloud Cover Climatology EarthEnv develop new near-global, fine-grain (\u22481km) monthly cloud frequencies from 15 years of twice-daily MODIS satellite images that expose spatio-temporal cloud cover dynamics of previously undocumented global complexity. We demonstrate that cloud cover varies strongly in its geographic heterogeneity and that the direct, observation-based nature of cloud-derived metrics can improve predictions of habitats, ecosystem, and species distributions with reduced spatial autocorrelation compared to commonly used interpolated climate data. These findings support the fundamental role of remote sensing as an effective lens through which to understand and globally monitor the fine-grain spatial variability of key biodiversity and ecosystem properties.

The algorithm used for the MOD16 data product collection is based on the logic of the Penman-Monteith equation, which includes inputs of daily meteorological reanalysis data along with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remotely sensed data products such as vegetation property dynamics, albedo, and land cover. Provided in the MOD16A2 product are layers for composited Evapotranspiration (ET), Latent Heat Flux (LE), Potential ET (PET) and Potential LE (PLE) along with a quality control layer. Two low resolution browse images, ET and LE, are also available for each MOD16A2 granule. The pixel values for the two Evapotranspiration layers (ET and PET) are the sum of all eight days within the composite period and the pixel values for the two Latent Heat layers (LE and PLE) are the average of all eight days within the composite period.

Tiles are generated by compositing 500 m observations from the 'MODIS/Terra Snow Cover Daily L3 Global 500m Grid' data set. Maximum snow cover extent is generated by reading 8 days of 500 m resolution MOD10A1 tiles. If snow is observed in a cell on any day in the period, the cell is mapped as snow. If no snow is found, the cell is filled with the clear-view observation that occurred most often (e.g. snow free land, ocean, etc.). Cloud cover is only reported if the cell was cloud-obscured for all eight days in the period. Snow cover is detected using the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI). Snow-covered land typically has a very high reflectance in visible bands and very low reflectance in the shortwave infrared; the NDSI reveals the magnitude of this difference.

The TCI is calculated using the equation, TCI = 100 * (LSTmax - LST)(LSTmax - LSTmin) where: LST is the current value of LST LSTmin is the long-term minimum value of LST. LSTmax is the long-term maximum value of LST.
