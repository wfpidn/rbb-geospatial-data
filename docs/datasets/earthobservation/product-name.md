## APHRODITE

The Asian Precipitation - Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources
(APHRODITE's Water Resources) project develops state-of-the-art daily precipitation datasets with high-resolution grids for Asia. The datasets are created primarily with data obtained from a rain-gauge-observation network. 

APHRODITE's Water Resources project has been conducted by the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature (RIHN) and the Meteorological Research Institute of Japan Meteorological Agency (MRI/JMA) since 2006.

### Precipitation

APHRO_V1901 are suite of precipitation products has been constructed by the Asian Precipitation - - Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of the Extreme Events (APHRODITE-2) project during June 2016 to March 2019. The aim of APHRODITE-2 is to refine APHRODITE algorithm to evaluate extreme events and to contribute meteorological analyses including improving forecasts.

### Temperature

AphroTemp_V1808 is daily mean temperature product as 0.50 and 0.25 degree gridded daily product. More data is collected and analyzed than AphroTemp_V1204R1 and data period is also extended to 2015. Topographical effect scheme is introduced to interpolation algorithm.

Surface observations in India, Bhutan, Thailand, Myanmar are added to the grid analysis after AphroTemp_V1204R1 Increase of them and improvement of interpolation algorithm, climate and estimated values in South Asia show good representation in new product.
